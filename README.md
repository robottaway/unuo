unuo is a simple Docker tool that allows you to kick off Docker builds from 
anywhere. Most likely this will involve a CI system calling, which in will 
prompt unuo to checkout the required Git repo and using the Dockerfile make a 
container. If you like it can push the container on build to a Docker registry.
